# Alpha Module

## Purpose

Use the Alpha module to create new modules by branching from `alpha` branch.

Ensure that module uses and passes the following commands:

- `composer test` - all tests must pass
- `composer cs` - all PSR-12 standards must pass
- `composer csfix` - this can be used to auto-fix many formatting issues
- `composer stan` - static analysis
- `composer cover` - as near as possible to 100% coverage should be achievable in a module
